### Hi there 🌊

My name's Christian (he/him), I'm part of the engineering team @ [Cherrypick (previously Lollipop)],
helping you and your household eat and shop more healthily and sustainably. 🍭

I used to be a developer on the Actions Core team @ [GitHub], helping you and
your team automate all the things and deliver value faster more easily. 🤖
